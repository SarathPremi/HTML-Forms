# DOM Manipulation with Forms

**This repository is created for submitting Task - 9**


This task involves creating a responsive web form and table using *HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (specifically DOM manipulation)* with the help of Bootstrap 5.

The form should include fields for *first name, last name, address, pincode, gender, choice of food (selecting at least 2 options out of 5), state, and country.* Upon submission, the data entered into the form should be dynamically added to a table, and the form fields should be cleared for further entries.
